        "🔴 At the beginning of the game, there will be information about the total cards and the table card.\n"
        "  ⚫️ Table card: This is the card that all players must match.\n\n"
        "🔴 The first turn will be chosen randomly by the bot. After that, the remaining players take turns in order.\n\n"
        "Card Details:\n"
        "⚪️ Each game includes 2️⃣ universal cards 🎴 and a Joker card 🃏.\n"
        "⚪️ A universal card can be used in place of the current table card.\n\n"
        "Gameplay:\n"
        "1. On your turn, you can send up to 3️⃣ cards at once.\n"
        "2. The next player will receive a message indicating how many cards you sent.\n"
        "3. They can choose to press the Liar button.\n\n"
        "   ⚫️ If the Liar button is pressed, the cards you sent will be revealed.\n"
        "     ⚫️ If there is at least one card that doesn't match either the universal card or the table card, you will be declared a liar and must shoot yourself.\n"
        "     ⚫️ However, if all your cards are correct, the player who pressed the Liar button will shoot themselves instead.\n\n"
        "Special Case:\n"
        "🔵 Joker Card 🃏:\n"
        "  ⚫️ If the Joker card is sent alone and the next player opens it, all players will shoot themselves except for the player who sent the Joker.\n\n"
        "Additional Rules:\n"
        "🔵 If you have no cards left, you will skip your turn until you receive new cards.\n"
        "🔵 Each time the Liar button is pressed, all cards will be redistributed.\n"
        "🔵 There are 6 bullets in your gun, but only 1 is real—the others are blanks, and no one knows which bullet is real.\n\n"
        "The game continues until only one player remains."
